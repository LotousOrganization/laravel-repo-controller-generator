## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

  

Hi, I'm **Sobhan Aali** â€” thank you for choosing this package!

  

This tool helps you quickly scaffold a full set of files for a CRUD resource in your Laravel project, including:

  

- âœ… **CRUD Controller**

- âœ… **Repository**

- âœ… **Form Requests** for `store` and `update`

## ðŸ“¦ Before You Start

Before running the command, make sure to **publish the stub files** that the generator uses as templates:

```bash

php artisan vendor:publish --tag=repo-controller-stubs

```

Also, don't forget to create and use a base model with the required trait:

```php

use SobhanAali\LaravelRepoControllerGenerator\Traits\GetFillables;

class BaseModel extends Model
{
    use GetFillables;
}

```

## ðŸš€ Usage

To generate a full **CRUD** setup for a resource, run the following command:

```bash

php artisan make:repo-controller Api/V1/Admin/CRUD/PostController

```
